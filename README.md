# Bring Popcorn

A movie search website. 

## Description   

Bring Popcorn is a movie search website that was developed with the goal of providing users with one, convenient location to discover and search for movies. By utilizing several third-party APIs, we deliver various pieces of data, eliminating the need for multiple applications to obtain movie-related information.
